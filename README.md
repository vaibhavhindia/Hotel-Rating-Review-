# Hotel-Rating-Review ( project 2 )
The goal of this project is to predict the rating of a hotel stay from a review in natural language using an Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network). There are two components: a Jupyter Notebook to train the model and a Streamlit or Flask App to use/show the model.

# Jupyter Notebook
The notebook is pretty straight forward.

1. Load the data (which is included in the repo, so it's easier for anyone to use it),

2. Separate data into training and test set

3. Preprocess data (which I did using a bag-of-words approach)

4. Design, train and save the network

5. TODO: Use test set to assess model accuracy
